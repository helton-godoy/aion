## 🎯 The AION Philosophy in Action

### Development Workflow
```
1. [ORCHESTRATOR] Analyzes requirements → Selects appropriate workflow
2. [PM] Creates PRD with full project context → Micro-commit [PM] [STEP-001]
3. [ARCHITECT] Designs system with memory awareness → Micro-commit [ARCH] [STEP-002]
4. [DEVELOPER] Implements with platform integration → Micro-commit [DEV] [STEP-003-010]
5. [QA] Validates with automated testing → Micro-commit [QA] [STEP-011]
6. [RELEASE] Deploys with platform features → Micro-commit [REL] [STEP-012]
7. [ORCHESTRATOR] Updates memory bank → Ready for next cycle
```

### Key Differentiators
- **Autonomous**: No human intervention required
- **Robust**: Built on production-tested framework
- **Safe**: Every operation tracked and reversible
- **Context-Aware**: Full project memory available
- **Platform-Native**: Uses platform features optimally
